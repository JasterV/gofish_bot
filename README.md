## Game description

```
Each participant will receive a private message with their status (cards in hand & score) after each turn.

Ask someone for a card, if they have it they will give you all the cards with that number, otherwise you will automatically draw a card.

If the card you've drawn is the same you asked for you can continue asking, otherwise the turn ends.

The game ends if someone has 0 cards in hand!
```
